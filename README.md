#### Objective:
Create a chatbot that provides drug-related information and insights based on real patient reviews, using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
#### Feature of the chatbot
Personalized Drug Recommendations: Based on user inputs like symptoms, concerns, or preferences, the chatbot can suggest drugs or present reviews that match the userâ€™s specific needs, helping them make more informed decisions.

### Steps :
Clean the reviews by removing unnecessary characters (e.g., punctuation, HTML tags).
Tokenize the text, remove stopwords, and normalize the text (e.g., lowercasing, stemming, or lemmatization).
Label the data for training (e.g., effectiveness, side effects, dosage)
